  <h1>Routers, Switches, and Hubs</h1>
  <p>Routers, switches, and hubs are essential components of modern computer networks.</p>
  <h2>Routers</h2>
  <p>Routers are devices that connect multiple networks together and forward data packets between them. They use routing tables to determine the best path for each packet, and can also provide security, network address translation (NAT), and other advanced networking features.</p>
  <h2>Switches</h2>
  <p>Switches are devices that connect multiple devices on a single network. They use data link layer (layer 2) addresses to forward data packets between devices on the same network, and can also provide advanced features such as VLANs and link aggregation.</p>
  <h2>Hubs</h2>
  <p>Hubs are simple networking devices that connect multiple devices on a single network. They forward incoming data packets to all connected devices, regardless of their destination. Hubs are generally considered outdated and have been replaced by switches in most modern networks.</p>
